## Analyzing the Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination

Authored by Cindy Li, Jacob Cash, Ismael Lagunes, and Povilas Juskevicius.

### Project Overview:
Our investigation revolves around two primary datasets: one tracking vaccination coverage across the globe, and the other detailing total cases and mortality rates, both categorized by region. Leveraging statistical methods such as linear regression, scatter plots, and time series analysis, we explore the relationships between vaccination metrics, COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccine efficacy.

### Key Findings:
The visual representation included in this README is a scatter plot comparing Vaccination Coverage and Covid-19-Deaths. It vividly illustrates the increase in vaccinations concerning the rise in COVID-19 cases over time. This graph serves as a snapshot encapsulating the broader trends explored in our project.

### Target Audience:
The intended audience for this project spans a diverse range, including researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in understanding the impact of COVID-19 vaccines. Researchers will find our statistical methods and analyses valuable for deeper exploration, while policymakers can gain insights into the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. For the general public, the visualizations provide a clear narrative on the positive outcomes linked to widespread vaccination.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project contributes to the ongoing global conversation on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. The figure presented here is just a glimpse of the comprehensive visualizations available in our complete work. By catering to a broad audience, we hope to foster a better understanding of the positive impact of vaccination efforts, encouraging continued support for these campaigns worldwide.
